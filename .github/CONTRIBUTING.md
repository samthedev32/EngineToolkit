# Contributing

## General

- Every change should follow the [FORMAT Requirements](#format)
- PRs should NOT change the core of the library
- try to keep backwards-compatibility

## Format

Rules:
- indents should be **2 spaces** (not tabs)
- everything should be under the namespace of the project
- features have to be tested and should have an associated example
- you should document what you've changed/made, noone else wants to do it
- if possible, implement **operator overloading** for your feature
