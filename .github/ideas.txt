UI Builder:
    - ui elements only have ratios, but not actual sizes
        - if something doesn't have a ratio (ratio == 0), it gets the max available space
        - if something has a ratio, it gets assigned the largest available space it can fit in
    - ui elements types are defined by flags (uint32_t)
        - first 1024 or so are preserved for internal use
            - cannot be user-defined
            - can be checked with a binary & operator
            - if unknown to renderer, should log an error
        - the rest are user-definable
            - user-defined render scripts

UI Renderer:
    - texts are rendered to textures, stored in a map (key is usage time), fixed number, oldests get re-rendered for different texts; on android in a low-memory event the # of texts can decrease (all the way to 0)
    - drawers and stuff like that gets rendered to a separate layer/texture; not re-rendered unless content is updates

Common:
    - Un-Pack
        - a .sh script that unpacks a specific part of the library
