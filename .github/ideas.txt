UI Builder:
    - 

UI Renderer:
    - texts are rendered to textures, stored in a map (key is usage time), fixed number, oldests get re-rendered for different texts; on android in a low-memory event the # of texts can decrease (all the way to 0)
    - drawers and stuff like that gets rendered to a separate layer/texture; not re-rendered unless content is updates
